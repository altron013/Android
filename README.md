As a home work assignment I made my first Android App,which is created based on Kaspi.kz mobile app.
This app contains two pages.First page is login page,second is main page.
I have wrote short piece of code to connect that two pages by using their id.
Also I have learned change the color of action bar,import the image from local source use textViews and buttons.
 Thank you ;)
